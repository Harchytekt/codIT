# codIT

codIT is a learning site for the programming in Python.

This is one of the projects of my second year at the Haute Ã‰cole en Hainaut for the _Projects Management_ course.

It's written in HTML/CSS and PHP. There're some JavaScript _(and jQuery)_ effects.  
The database was created with MySQL.
